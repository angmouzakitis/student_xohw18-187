Buterfly NoC Firewall sources for the HLS Design (no optimazation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the systemC sources for the Buterfly NoC Firewall and it's testbench.

The synthesis systemC source files are the four_port_sw.ccp, four_port_sw.h, and packet.h. The rest source files are used for the simulation.

The top module for the synthesis is the four_port_sw class.

All required pragmas & defines are in source.

We used Vivado HLS 2014.4.1 edition.

More about the functionality of the Buterfly NoC Firewall can be read in the Linux Driver Example Readme File.
